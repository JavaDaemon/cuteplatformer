cute platformer
==========

This is a small platformer written in Java, using LibGDX. The resources used by the project has been left out of the git, however, it should be relatively simple to get it to run. Sprites are packed with the TexturePacker from LibGDX.

You can e-mail me if you have any questions about this.
